  The Dawn of Symbiosis: Humanity's Turbulent Entry into the Collective Era
overview: |
  At the start of humanity's journey into Collective Symbiosis, Earth was in crisis.

  People were afraid and mistrustful as they began merging with alien entities and technologies.

  Early attempts often led to disasters, raising serious ethical questions.

  Society was divided, with intense debates about losing personal freedom for a chance at evolving beyond human limits.

  Governments and secret groups forced people into joining, causing panic and resistance.

  Key events like the failed experiment in New Geneva, where a symbiosis trial went horribly wrong, highlighted the chaos of this period.

  Humanity struggled with its new path, merging with a vast, unknown collective.
